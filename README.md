# ML-based-Prediction-and-Analysis-of-Agri-Food-CO2-Emissions

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict **CO₂ emissions** in the agriculture and food sector.  
The model is deployed with **Streamlit** for an interactive dashboard where users can input values (in kilotonnes) and get predicted emissions.  

---

## Features  
- **Random Forest Model** trained on agricultural emission data  
- Supports multiple numeric input features (in **kilotonnes, kt**)  
- Streamlit-powered web app with clean UI 
- Model persistence using `joblib`

## Installation

```
streamlit
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
joblib
```

---

## Usage

### Train the Model

Open Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook train_model.ipynb
```

This will:

* Load and clean dataset
* Train a **Random Forest Regressor**
* Save the model as `co2_model.pkl` and feature names as `features.pkl`

---

### Run Streamlit Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser at **[http://localhost:8501/](http://localhost:8501/)**

---

## Example Workflow

1. Enter input values for features (e.g., fertilizer use, crop yield, livestock, etc.)
2. Click **Predict CO₂ Emissions**
3. Get predictions in **kilotonnes (kt)**

---

## Model Details

* **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regressor
* **Input**: Numeric agricultural features (all in **kt**)
* **Output**: Predicted CO₂ emissions (kt)
* **Evaluation**:

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * R² Score

---

## Future Improvements

* Add visualizations (feature importance, trends)
* Build a forecasting model for future predictions based on different parameters.
* Extend dataset for better accuracy
